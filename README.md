## Project for advanced algorithmics course

TODO:

- DONE Implement sampling 

- DONE Implement stop/reset on button click

- DONE Per channel color mutation

- Add mutation of adding a polynome
    * maybe add 3 different mutations with different starting polynomes
    * think how this will not be abused

- Add 2-level mutations (maybe if one mutation per turn doesn't yield a more optimal solution)

- Add weighing of sampled point distances based on y coordinate of sampled point (linear probably)

- Implement selection of base images (ie show 5 images, on clicking the image the approximation starts)
